Computery Guy's Song

Parte 1

I'm a computer, I'm a computery guy
Everything made out of buttons and wires
I'd like to show ya inside my digital life
Inside my mind there is a digital mind

Parte 2

Clever, I'm very clevery guy
Count to a 50 in the blink of my eye
And print a picture, and then I tell you the time

Help you to find something you're wanting to find
No, it's easy to be a clever smart boy like me
If you could to it all digitally-yyyyyyyyyy!
